**   Six years of creative research **  
The Media Technology MSc programme is a place where students are encouraged to formulate their own scientific questions, and to translate personal inspirations and curiosities into their own research projects. To answer these questions, students are stimulated to create actual installations and products because we are convinced that by doing and creating, new scientific insights into the underlying question are encountered.

The exhibition is divided in three parts:
- Selected installations realised in the last six years. This is a mixture of graduation works and other works that have been realised during the study.
- Results from the current second semester project. Small groups of students have been exploring different topics. This has lead to statements that have been translated into exhibitable work.
- Hands-on laboratory. In the laboratory students will be working on their own research that is already presentable to an audience.

The Media Technology programme is a joint initiative of Leiden University's computer science institute (LIACS) and the Faculty of Creative and Performing Arts.

**   July 10th - Opening day **  

15:00
Lecture by Koert van Mensvoort
Koert van Mensvoort is both a scientist and an artist. He will use his own work and fascinations as starting point to reflect on Media Technology. Koert is intrigued by 'Next Nature'. Next Nature is culturally emerged nature.

17:00
Opening of the exhibition by Alex Adriaansens (director of V2_)

**   July 12th - Graduation presentations **  

Four graduation projects will be presented:
*14:00-14:45 Alex Reuneker: the influence of interactivity on immersion in literature
*14:45-15:30 Sylvain Vriens: surveillance: the new urban religion / defining reality
*15:30-16:15 Erik Hekman / Michiel Stade: continuous physical prototyping in generative design: a LEGO-based architecture approach

The presentations are public and open for anyone that is interested to attend.


**   July 17th - TOKO Workshop **  
14:00-20:00
TOKO workshops are about technical topics in the field of art, design and technology. Get inspiration or technical help from all the participants for your own creative projects. Each workshop speakers are being invited to share their knowledge and experiences. This 5th TOKO will be about RFID, radio-frequency identification, the tags commonly used in all kinds of plastic cards like access badges and library cards.

Confirmed speakers for this TOKO are: Iris Douma (http://tovernoot.nl), Leo van der Veen (http://nr37.nl) and Marc Boon (http://marcboon.com). Iris and Leo will show examples of creative use of RFID and will have a hands-on session where you will be using tags and readers yourself. Marc's session will also be very hands-on. He created the 'RFID sniffer', a simple analog electronic circuit which can detect the presence of RFID tags. You can buy some electronic parts from him and solder your own RFID sniffer during the workshop.

The workshop is open for everyone. Please send an email to toko@dewar.nl to register for free and get more information. Visit http://dewar.nl/toko for the latest news.

**   July 19th - Masterclass Creative Research **  
14:00-17:00
There must be more room for creativity and unconventional ideas in scientific research. Only through dealing creatively with research itself can we achieve results that could otherwise not be envisioned, and can science remain groundbreaking. Just as in the Dutch concept of autonomous artists, there should be free-thinking and creative scientists - autonomous scientists.
This idea is central in the Media Technology MSc programme of Leiden University. In the masterclass this creative research concept is presented - with many examples  - and is much room for discussion. Some examples and results of unconventional scientific research are presented as installations in the exposition.
The masterclass is taught by Maarten Lamers and Bas Haring (Leiden University, Media Technology MSc programme) and is part of the six years creative research exposition presented by the V2_Institute for the Unstable Media.
The masterclass is free and open for anyone that is interested to attend. It's advised to register at http://mediatechnology.leiden.edu/masterclass/

**   Exhibition **  

The exhibition features the following projects

**   Team Untangle **  
Matthew Jarvis
Casper Schipper
Lieven van Velthoven

How do people solve problems together, which strategy proves best? Or might we even be better off alone?  By providing a deceptively simple game in a large interactive playfield, Team Untangle tries to explore and measure our problem solving behaviour.

**   Infinite Nothingness **  
Aggelos Bousmpouras
Clintonne Kip
Mario Ruiz

Starting from a point (zero dimensional object), fractal worlds are unveiled. Hidden behind a seeming nothingness, each one with its own soundscape, unfolding to new worlds and new sounds... ad infinitum. The goal of this project is to allow the user to create and manipulate these sounds my means of fractals.

**   Seismic Body Signals **  
Anja Hofele
Thomas Kusch
Myriam Traub
Katja Wahl

Fogpatch has reconstructed a traumatic body experience of the German cybernetician Max Bense, which he described in the text "Existenzmitteilung aus San Franzisko" written in 1970. Seismic signals and recordings from the Golden Gate Bridge represent the thoughts of the Cartesian philosopher, who worked in depth on the topic of where art and technology intersect.

**   Love Will Tear Us Apart **  
Stelios Gianoullis
Bastiaan Terhorst

Relationships need distance, but also closeness. Awareness for the necessity of this constant change is created by using it as a seed for the environment. Compelled to move within the space, participants try to find the ideal distance and claim their love balance. 

**   Tick-Tech **  
Sanne Fennema
Dunya K?rkal?
Wilco Tomassen

Is the use of technology for the better, simpler and more practical or not? Experience the development of technologies through time and its impact on our daily human life.

**   The Immortaliser **  
Lisa Dalhuijsen
Richard Hardstone
Antal Ruhl

Your actions have an infinite effect on the world, although it's not always clear how. The Immortaliser captures you as a visitor of the exhibition, and turns your actions into a statue. You will be remembered forever.

**   Harmonoise **  
Christian Detweiler
Hanco Hogenbirk
Danica Mast

Disruption of personal or collective harmony in music. You influence the world around you and the world influences you... Collective harmony can only exist, if you are willing to give up certain personal desires.

**   I Am Always Here **  
Sylvain Vriens

We believe in CCTV as an almost absolute truth, an above-human system literally watching over us. It defines a new urban reality. How do we fit in this panopticonal reality and how do we know if we even exist in it? Does the system register our reality or its own?

**   ShameStation **  
Ralph Kok
Nicolette Lelieveld
Jeroen Oliemans

Suppose you could control another person to the extent of making this person hurt other people, would you still be able to feel emotions such as shame and guilt? Who should feel guilty or ashamed; the one who actually hurts someone or the one who controls this person?

**   Globe4D **  
Rick Companje
Nico van Dijk
Hanco Hogenbirk
Danica Mast

This hands-on, interactive, four-dimensional globe shows on a physical sphere how our planet changes over time. Animations about the Earth's history and future, changing seasons, real-time earthquakes, daylight changes, human migration and other planets are just a few examples of the unlimited possibilities created by this new way of globe viewing.

**   MusicalNodes **  
Lisa Dalhuijsen
Lieven van Velthoven

A music library that combines physics-based visualisation with direct manipulation of the music.

**   Sound Illusion Cube **  
Thijs Eerens

SIC is an installation build to research if people get spatial disorientated by only sound and movement. It's based on the madhouse principle in fun parks but instead of people seeing a rotating room, they now only hear rotating sound while they are blinded sitting in a moving chair. According to the test results, SIC is working and so people can get spatial disoriented by sound and movement.

**   Cyclotactor **  
Staas de Jong

This lab session will provide a look over the shoulder at ongoing
research at LIACS into tactile interaction for new musical interfaces.

**   Life24 **  
Joey van Dijk 
Maurice Kraanen 
Chris Pieplenbosch

Virtual globalizing the world, by individual understanding, formed in 1 space, using the current forms of digital media in the here and now.

**   Twilight Films presents: The man with the stick **  
Stijn Belle
Antonis Lyras

Are our mental images a copy of reality? Or is reality a copy of our mental images? You could all be part of some reality without even knowing about it. You could all become part of my reality without even wanting it. And you will... Welcome to the Twilight Zone.

**   OutRandom **  
Tiago Borges Coelho
Christina Papakonstantinou
Maarten Wesselius

OutRandom is a game in which the only task for players is to push the buttons in an order which is as unpredictable as possible. Who is most random, wins. OutRandom shows that acting randomly can be a gaming skill that you can train. It challenges you to think of strategies for being random.

**   Reaction Machine **  
Jonas Hielscher
Klaas Jan Mollema

The interactive installation Reaction Machine plays with the intimate field of tension between the people. Balance of power, personal input and connecting old and new technology are all part of this experience. Reaction Machine is an open system, in which the visitor's reaction determines the art work.

**   BugMan **  
Wim van Eck

Is it possible to merge the unpredictable behaviour of an animal with a computer game by replacing parts of the computer code with animal behaviour? How will this affect the game? To study these questions, a variant of Pac-Man was created in which the virtual ghosts are controlled by real crickets.

**   Basil do Brazil **  
Dunya K?rkal?
Antal Ruhl

Neural networks combined with evolutionary algorithms, visualised as bacteria who can move, eat, grow, learn and multiply.
