===== Summary =====
*Gordon Bell is creating a complete virtual memory to supplement his own imperfect one, a defiant, Proustian reclamation of lost time that may be changing the very way we think about the past. But why?
*computer as a real extension of your brain
*[[LifeBrowser]], [[Remembrance Agent]], [[FacetMap]]
*FacetMap: It's this beautiful sort of graphical interface where you can zoom down on any one thing and it's connected to everything else.
*Psychologists have long discovered that we organize our memories very often based on people and time. And if you put those two things together, you can index the vast majority of your memories very quickly.
*we have the luxury of forgetting it  but not these phone numbers. Without our cell phones, we're lost.
*actually, in Europe, where their phone really has thousands of phone numbers and emails, because it's their central device and there is a huge anxiety about losing your phone or losing the memory on your phone. They have all these backup devices for like saving all your phone information, because they'd just be like emotionally destroyed if they lose their phone, because everything was on it. You know, it's like having a stroke. The information's all gone.
*[[Jim Gemmell]] .... But what happened was that he had a crash and he lost about four months of it. And up until then, he had sort of thought, well, this is just this funny little experiment. I'm doing it to sort of learn how to make this software. I don't really rely on this stuff. But once the information was gone, he realized that he did rely on it, that it was like hot water or lights in his house, and that when he lost it, he felt absolutely bereft. 
*What these guys in Ireland discovered was that if, at the end of the day, you look at all those pictures, just flip, flip, flip, really quickly scroll through them in about a minute, you relive your day as seen out
your eyes, and it dramatically improves your long-term recall of what happened
*applied to people who ar afflicted with short-term memory impairment, right?
*I guess I still find puzzling why we need this kind of recall in our everyday life, unless you believe, as many people do, that really all we are are our memories. Are we fuller, more complete people if we can hold onto that stuff?
*people will sort of make decisions about what type of memory they want to have.
*these little snapshots that represent an entire year in your life.
*you recall everything, and it's a really majestic, almost poetic way of looking at your life.
*Privacy
*There are parts of your life that maybe you shouldn't remember, and making sense of your life is as much about forgetting the  vast majority of it or subtly distorting it as it is perfectly remembering it.
*being able to reexperience directly everything might be sort of nightmarish.
