Prismic is a headless content management system (CMS) that allows developers to build custom websites and applications by providing an API to manage and deliver content. It is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing developers to build the front-end of a website or application using their preferred programming languages and tools, while using Prismic to manage and store the content. Prismic provides a web-based content editor that allows content creators to easily create, edit, and publish content, which can then be accessed and displayed by the custom front-end built by developers using the Prismic API.
