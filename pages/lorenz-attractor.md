title: Lorenz Attractor
---
<blockquote>The Lorenz attractor, named for Edward N. Lorenz, is a 3-dimensional structure corresponding to the long-term behavior of a chaotic flow, noted for its butterfly shape. The map shows how the state of a dynamical system (the three variables of a three-dimensional system) evolves over time in a complex, non-repeating pattern.

Lorenz Attractor for Processing 1.0.1 by Rick Companje, 5 december 2008. Based on a Processing sketch by Sunghun Kim. Showing the noninear diferential equation described by Lorenz, E. N. (1963). "Deterministic nonperiodic flow". J. Atmos. Sci. 20: 130-141.

The Lorenz atractor is generated by the following noninear diferential equations:
```
  dx/dt = s ( y - x )
  dy/dt = r x - y - xz
  dz/dt = xy - b z
```
