# TestDisk & PhotoRec
* **TestDisk** is powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software: certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting a Partition Table). Partition table recovery using TestDisk is really easy.
* **PhotoRec** is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents and archives from hard disks (Mechanical Hard drives, Solid State Drives...), CD-ROMs, and lost pictures (thus the Photo Recovery name) from digital camera memory. PhotoRec ignores the file system and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your media's file system has been severely damaged or reformatted.
