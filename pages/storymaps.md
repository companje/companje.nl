# How is StoryMaps different than ArcGIS StoryMaps?
* **StoryMaps**: is a new product that is not part of the ArcGIS System. Itâ€™s designed for anyone who wants to share stories about topics they are passionate about like their favorite food, sports, music, places, friends and family.
* **ArcGIS StoryMaps** is for organisations to share their GIS-related stories with citizens, as internal presentations, etc. It is integrated into the ArcGIS System.</blockquote>
