title: Toko #18 - Communication Protocols
---
On March 21st, 2010 there will be an OpenToko workshop about Communication Protocols.
<blockquote>In the field of telecommunications, a communications protocol is the set of standard rules for data representation, signaling, authentication and error detection required to send information over a communications channel. ... Communication protocol is basically following certain rules so that the system works properly. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol|wikipedia]]</blockquote>
Lots of stuff out there communicates in certain electronic languages: internet, radio, television, telephones, computer screens, computer networks, USB devices, remote controls etc. This OpenToko will cover the similarities and differences between quite some protocols.

Edwin Dertien will kick-off this Toko giving a general introduction and supplying a context dividing the day in the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model|7 OSI-layers]].

In the morning protocols within the low-level 'media layers' (physical layer etc.) will be covered. Followed by higher-level protocols from the 'host layers' in the afternoon. This sounds quite theoretical but of course lots of nice hands-on stuff will be supporting each layer (like MIDI devices, DMX controllers, VT100 keyboard from the 70's, DIY AM Radio, Arduino generating video signal, OpenSoundControl iPhone-MaxMSP link and more).
