Yesterday I visited the monthly META meeting. META stands for [[:Making Electronic Thingies in Amsterdam]]. At this meeting I learned to know about a new initiative called Fritzing. In the spirit of Processing and Arduino, [[http://fritzing.org|Fritzing]] is an open-source initiative to support designers and artists to take the step from physical prototyping to actual product. So after you have a working prototype on your breadboard Fritzing comes in to get it from a prototype to a produced print.

<blockquote>Fritzing is an open-source initiative to support designers and artists to take the step from physical prototyping to actual product. We are aiming to create a software in the spirit of Processing and Arduino, that allows the designer/artist/researcher/hobbyist to document their Arduino-based prototype and create a PCB layout for manufacturing. The complimenting website helps to share and discuss drafts and experiences as well as to reduce manufacturing costs.</blockquote>
